# Implemented improvements:

- Static field improvement - Different values and relaxation,
  diagonal movement is "longer" than horizontal and vertical.

- Walls have repulsion force (force strength easily
  customizable)

- Random order of pedestrain's movement

- Second type of exit (yellow). Pedestrians have decision
  process of chosing an exit. Added dynamic field that is
  calculated once every 20 iterations. It indicates the
  congestion level of each exit.
